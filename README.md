## Other Notes
I really enjoyed creating this once I finally sat down and started designing and I hope you enjoy looking at this too. 

Some pain points:
- anchoring sections between pages was a nightmare, for this part of the submission I removed them because they were litterally doing my head in. I have always struggled with linking anchor links between pages while in build mode, I can only seem to get them working when they are on a live page. 
- my code reminds me of embrodiary, on the front, it looks nice and works well. But behind it is a huge mess. Throughout this course I am planning on going back in and stripping out all the useless pieces or better yet finding better ways at writing it. 
- as mentioned above, my site isn't responsive.... yet. I hope to have this one all done and dusted within the next few days.
